 I have created this project using html and javascript where I have used database to store all the information of students using JsonPowerDB.
 JsonPowerDB is very fast and secure database that we can store data very efficiently. It also provides serverless support and most important fastes indexing 
 engine whcih is PowerIndex. There are lot of benefits of using JsonPowerDB that can store structured / semi-structured and unstructured data along with other
 types of files and big-data. Also it is very useful for data analytics abd Geopatial time series analytics.
